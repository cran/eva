Description: Goodness-of-fit tests for selection of r in the r-largest order
    statistics (GEVr) model. Goodness-of-fit tests for threshold selection in the
    peaks-over-threshold approach. Random number generation and density functions
    for the GEVr distribution. Profile likelihood for return level estimation
    using the GEVr and generalized pareto distributions. P-value adjustments for
    sequential, multiple testing error control.
